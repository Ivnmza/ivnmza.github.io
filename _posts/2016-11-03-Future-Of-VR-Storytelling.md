#### Stories, myths, fables - Storytelling is almost in inexorable part of the human experience
VR is surely no different in this sense.. Except for one thing. In VR, we are telling stories in space.

VR means a lot of different things to a lot of people.

But for clarity's sake let us suffice to describe VR here as HMD's, mobile devices, domes and panoramas, 360 degree static views, location based interactive applications: anything that takes a viewer and puts them in an environment enveloping them visually and aurally.

To start exploring vr, we first have to experience it, that goes almost without saying, but usually escapes most naysayers.
I believe a nuanced understanding of emotive audiovisual language will drive novel applications of VR.

Great storytelling is about keeping the audiences attention, telling stories in space requires alot of different consideration, cinematic technique requires framing and subject so the audience sees exactly what the director intends them to see.

But while VR offers many exciting new elements, a huge chunk of the director's tool kit is rendered unapplicable. Close ups, Selective Depth of Field, Editing Rhythm & Pace, etc.

##### THIS LEADS TO MANY QUESTIONS
How do we que the Viewer to lead them along the story's path?
How do we maintain a common viewer experience in our own space and timeline?
How do we create the communal viewing experience?
And importantly, how do we consider viewer fatigue for longer entertainment experiences?

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW DO WE AVOID LITERALLY MAKING OUR AUDIENCES SICK??


#### WE'VE HAD OVER 100 YEARS OF DEVELOPING A CINEMATIC LANGUAGE
THERE ARENT TOO MANY EXPERTS AROUND IN THIS FIELD YET
BUT TOGETHER WE WILLL DEVELOP TECHNIQUES TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES
