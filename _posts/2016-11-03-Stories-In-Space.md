#### Stories, myths, fables - Storytelling is almost in inexorable part of the human experience
VR is surely no different in this sense.. Except for one thing. In VR, we are telling stories in space.

VR means a lot of different things to a lot of people.

But for clarity's sake let us suffice to describe VR here as HMD's, mobile devices, domes and panoramas, 360 degree static views, location based interactive applications: anything that takes a viewer and puts them in an environment enveloping them visually and aurally.

To start exploring vr, we first have to experience it, that goes almost without saying, but usually escapes most naysayers.

I believe a nuanced understanding of emotive audiovisual language will drive novel applications of VR.

Great storytelling is about keeping the audiences attention, 
telling stories in space requires alot of different consideration, 
cinematic technique requires framing and subject so the audience sees exactly what the director intends them to see.

But while VR offers many exciting new elements, a huge chunk of the director's tool kit is rendered unapplicable. 
Close ups, Selective Depth of Field, Editing Rhythm & Pace, etc.

##### This leads to many questions 
How do we que the Viewer to lead them along the story's path?

How do we maintain a common viewer experience in our own space and timeline?

How do we create the communal viewing experience?

And importantly, how do we consider viewer fatigue for longer entertainment experiences?

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW DO WE AVOID LITERALLY MAKING OUR AUDIENCES SICK??


#### WE'VE HAD OVER 100 YEARS OF DEVELOPING A CINEMATIC LANGUAGE
There aren't too many experts in this area yet, but together we will develop techniques to overcome these challenges.

About a month ago we announced were building 

Simultaneous multi projection
VL SLI Compute on left and Compute on right
NVIDIA is working with haptics, HMD, Graphic engines, app developers, working to augment the toolset
applciations in medical and manufacturing
most visib in media, bc of great content
nvidia trying do whatever they can tto make as easy as possible for the best experience for customers
Theme parks are the original VR
Toy Story Mania - one of first VR Project using 3d digital projection to immerse guests
Much more of a game than linear narrative.
Learning novel interfaces.
building immersive storytelling experiences
an intersection between gaming, gaming ethos, and narrative storytelling ques
The agency problem, not being able to direct the viewers
so then passive techniques are used, set design, making visible action long enough, or even the action only being triggered unless the viewer looks that way
focus mapped vr flow. head orientation dictates flow of events, in or near real time
The Martian VR 30 minutes coming on tethered
How do i direct this story, how do i make someone pay attention to this term of "exactly what i want them to see"
I believe that is the wrong way to look at it
#### What big studios have learned
Exe
wheweeeeew
we made it out alive
