- Ask me about the future
im full of myself in the actualized semse. a good snese of who i am. I'm a bright guy and all but really I just know how to make sense and understanding. i think the point that am is that ive truly found my core self. and its been established, i know my core self now, on top that im using that base to elevate and transcend through innovative experiential life installations, like i see my life as art. In a sense i Live in my personal solipsist realith in that i really feel like im neo in this matrix, bc i literally will make a diff in this worlk, it really is doest nmake much, just getting with like indede people and making it happen.

I have an animal spirit of chamaeleon of interest and im good at synergizing in.

gotta take it there we all die one day
